A hash table implementation I made to use somewhere else

I made this for two reasons
* I wanted a hash table implementation to use somewhere else.
* I wanted to figure out how hash tables work by making one.

Long story short: I didn't want to learn how to use someone else's work if I'm only going to use it once, especially since I'm probably going to use it in a personal project (prototype) where it doesn't matter how good it is. So, I figured I might as well make it myself so I can at least learn from it.
